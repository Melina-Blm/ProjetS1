            <h2 class="article__title">Women in cinema : a past full of stereotypes</h2>

            <p class="article__intro">Nowadays, equality between women and men is a recurrent theme of reflection, which sometimes can become "trendy".</p>
            <p class="article__intro">But how was it several years ago ?</p>
            <article>

             <!--INTERTITRE-->
 
                <h3 class="article__intertitre">A burden to carry</h3>
                <p class="article__content">Women’s position has always been at the heart of issues everywhere in the world. Over the years, many people have assimilated the idea that a woman does not have the same intellectual and physical abilities as a man.</p>
                <p class="article__content">Therefore, women are inferior to men and do not have the same rights. In addition, there are many stereotypes that surround women. Some say they are too emotional, weak and easily influenced.</p>

                <div class="article__image">
                <img src="public/img/charlichap.webp" alt="Charlie Chaplin">
                </div>
                <div class="article__legende">
                <p>Charlie Chaplin.</p>
                </div>


                <p class="article__content">For centuries, equality between individuals was based on the rights of men and not all people. Constantly called to order, women had no choice but to limit themselves to the status of wife and mother. A woman's professional life was constantly questioned.</p>
                <p class="article__content">In this context, a wave of demands was created and led to a movement : feminism.</p>
                <p class="article__content">The goal was to drastically reform the institutions and to include more women on the same scale as men. At that time, a glimmer of hope was reborn.</p>


            <!--INTERTITRE-->

                <h3 class="article__intertitre">What about the cinema ?</h3>

                <p class="article__content">Even if women became more and more known in the public sphere, it is difficult to say the same thing about the film industry. Often sidelined because of their status, it took them many years and a lot of strength for them to finally be recognized worldwide.</p>
                <p class="article__content">Alice Guy, born in 1873 in Saint-Mandé is the perfect example. She became the first woman to direct films in the history of cinema. In 1896, she shot “La Fée aux choux”, which was a huge success. From directing to producing, Alice Guy was an important figure in the recognition of women in the film industry.</p>

            <!--INTERTITRE-->

                <h3 class="article__intertitre">A misrepresentation.</h3>
                <p class="article__content">However, the representation did not get any better. Often represented in sexist and cruel portraits that do not really match, it took quite some time for them to break the silence.</p>
                <p class="article__content">In fact, Sleeping Beauty is a popular story tale released in 1959 by Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. This tale talks about a gorgeous, intelligent and kind princess. One day, an evil fairy appears and casts a spell that puts the princess into a deep and profound sleep. A prince, out of curiosity, found the princess and kissed her. This is how he frees the princess from her sleep.</p>

                <div class="article__legende">
                <p>The Sleeping Beauty.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article__content">At that time, movies mainly featured a cute and naive girl who finds herself in a situation where only a man can save her.</p>
                <p class="article__content">It’s only In the '90s that we notice a difference in the representation of women in the cinema’s field, especially through movies like  Mulan.</p>

                <div class="article__image3">
                <img src="public/img/pocahontas.webp" alt="Pocahontas">
                </div>
                <div class="article__legende">
                <p>Pocahontas.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article__content">It is therefore throughout the years that women have established themselves. Through many fights and struggles, the representation of women in the cinema has improved a lot.</p>
                <p class="article__content">Nowadays, the fight still continues with different figures who have an important role. Jennifer Lawrence is the perfect example of a committed and feminist actress.</p>

                <h2 class="article__title">Heroines in the foreground.</h2>
            
                <p class="article__intro">For so many years, women in the film industry were often associated with a rather sexist archetype and difficult to break away from it.  </p>
                <p class="article__intro">They are often perceived as a seductive assets whose purpose is to seduce the strong and courageous male protagonist.</p>
                <h3 class="article__intertitre">A dystopian movie.</h3>
                <p class="article__content">Towards the 2010s, women are perceived in a different way. In fact, Hunger Games is one of the films that played a huge role in the improvement of the representations of women in the film industry. In 2013, the movie came in first place with the category "female lead character".</p>
                <p class="article__content">Hunger Games puts us into a dystopian world where the nation of Panem is divided into 12 districts, ruled by the Capitol, a dictatorship. To punish the citizens who caused a revolt, each district is forced to choose two candidates, a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18, who must fight till death in the annual Hunger Games, until only one survivor remains. Played by Jennifer Lawrence, Katniss Everdeen is the heroine of the Hunger Games trilogy.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="article__content"> During the selections for the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen’s sister is chosen. In order to spare her from an inevitable death, Katniss volunteers. Throughout the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen's journey is told as she fights against an authoritarian power and tries to make the world a better and equal place.</p>
                <p class="article__content">Through this saga, we can ask ourselves about the way the movie represents women. This kind of movie can be described as a rise of feminism within the film industry where the heroine, Katniss Everdeen, is part of the revolution. Throughout the story, the protagonist is portrayed as a fearless hunter.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="article__content">Very tough and agile, Katniss Everdeen is an authority figure. During the Hunger Games, her main goal is to survive, even if it means using extreme violence. Faced with the dictatorship of the Capitol, she becomes a symbol of rebellion and breaks the female stereotypes that revolve around her.</p>
                <p class="article__content">Indeed, society expects her to be a woman with traits that a woman can have : kind, naive and fearful. Katniss breaks the traditional ideals of female representation (love, motherhood, wisdom) and becomes instead the symbol of resistance to a power that is becoming increasingly corrupt. She is the hope for the nation of Panem. The interpretation of Katniss Everdeen allows Jennifer Lawrence to identify perfectly with her role. </p>
                <p class="article__content">Both characters share the same ambitions and values. They challenge the stereotypes of female representations in cinema and offer new possibilities for the women of tomorrow.</p><br>
